                <p>
                    With balls in his durag, he sags fearin' no man<br>
                    He stands, pen in his hand like Edward Scissorhands<br>
                    Who slices competition and just goes about his business<br>
                    Anyone who knows about him knows about his shindig
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shenanigans and all his wacky antics in the papers<br>
                    Shady's danglin' a baby tangled in a blanket, stranglin'<br>
                    And hangin' him over the railing by the ankles on some gangster shit<br>
                    Child endangerment, dark brain, arcane with it, Mark Twainin' it
                </p>
                <p>
                    You aren't tamin' it, sharp pain in the heart<br>
                    Aimin' a bar, chamber to carve names in it<br>
                    Start sprayin' and start ravin' on beef, stark ravin' it<br>
                    You're at arm's length, you're in harm's way of it
                </p>
                <p>
                    'Bout to show your ass why I'm still a pain in it<br>
                    You wanna know how I do it? I can't explain this shit<br>
                    Mechanic's brain with a pinch of Big Daddy Kane in it<br>
                    But I can show you the ropes 'til you get the hang of it
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elephantiasis of the nuts, element<br>
                    Of Intelligent Hoodlum, Arrested Development<br>
                    Cella Dwellas and Wise Intelligent, since elementary<br>
                    Through Hell I went, accelerant from lack of melanin
                </p>
                <p>
                    Failin' in school, smart aleck wit<br>
                    Helped me to rebel against shit so well and vent<br>
                    So eloquently, yet I was irrelevant<br>
                    Soon as I quit givin' a fuck, I started to sell a bit
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now let's travel inside the mind of a hater<br>
                    'Cause I don't see no fans, all I see's a bunch of complainers<br>
                    &ldquo;Kendrick's album was cool, but it didn't have any bangers<br>
                    &ldquo;Wayne's album or Ye's, couldn't tell you which one was lamer
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Joyner's album was corny, Shady's new shit is way worse<br>
                    &ldquo;Everything is either too tame or there's too much anger<br>
                    &ldquo;I didn't like the beat, so I hated Might Delete Later&rdquo;<br>
                    You nerdy pricks would find somethin' wrong with 36 Chambers
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's what they do to the greats<br>
                    Pick apart a Picasso and make excuses to hate<br>
                    So you can wait for your flowers until you're blue in the face, stupid<br>
                    You ain't gonna get 'em until your funeral wake
                </p>
