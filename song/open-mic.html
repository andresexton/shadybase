                    I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed<br>
                    The way you're hacked and sliced when I fill your back with knives<br>
                    Jackin' lifes of MCs, now I'm set to launch a plan<br>
                    For blowin' up the stage with illegal contraband
                </p>
                <p>
                    I stomped your man, so unless you want what he got<br>
                    You better set the mic down, I'm steamin' like a teapot<br>
                    I make the D hot, people get in my face and ask<br>
                    If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's an amazin' task to battle with success<br>
                    I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less<br>
                    And win a slug fest, I get physical like physicians<br>
                    Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for ya<br>
                    When I torture ya throughout the course of my orchestra<br>
                    So feel the force of my spiritual images<br>
                    Slicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages
                </p>
                <p>
                    My skin itches every time a rapper recites<br>
                    And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites<br>
                    You wanna see fights, I got a match for ya<br>
                    You couldn't flip shit playin' in toilets with a spatula

                    I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces<br>
