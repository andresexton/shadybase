                    Attention all units, attention all units<br>
                    We have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair<br>
                    I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair<br>
                    He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife<br>
                    Proceed with caution, watch your back fellas<br>
                    He could be coming after your girlfriend next

                    There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward<br>
                    His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward<br>
                    He'll stab you with a sword, don't be fooled by his charm<br>
                    He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair<br>
                    Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there<br>
                    He has a mean stare, but usually cracks jokes<br>
                    Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks

                    Sneezin' at dust and swingin' at the spider webs<br>
                    Inside the depths of his basement<br>

                    Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned<br>
                    They're only powerful when you got your back turned<br>
                    I yearned for the day that we finally met again<br>

                    He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean<br>
                    I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen<br>
                    Cuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home<br>
                    Beating him over the head with the telephone
