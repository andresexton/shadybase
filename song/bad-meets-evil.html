                    I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts<br>
                    You know, there's a story behind that there saloon<br>
                    Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over<br>
                    Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em<br>
                    Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen<br>
                    Got murdered in cold blood<br>
                    That old saloon there was their little home away from home<br>
                    They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern<br>
                    And on a quiet night, you can still hear<br>
                    The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5&lsquo;9&ldquo;
                </p>

                    <em>Eminem (&amp; Royce da 5&lsquo;9&ldquo;):</em><br>
                    I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet<br>
                    I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat<br>
                    I translate when my voice is read<br>
                    Through a seismograph and the noise is spread<br>
                    Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (Uhh)<br>
                    Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed<br>
                    'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead<br>
                    Told him each one of his boys is dead (Ohh)<br>
                    I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said (Yo)

                    Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse<br>
                    We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other<br>
                    To see which one'll swerve first<br>
                    Two blind bandits panic<br>
                    Whose mental capacity holds that of a globe<br>
                    On top of nine other planets<br>
                    Kissed the cheek of the Devil<br>
                    Intelligence level is hellier than treble<br>
                    Peakin' on speakers in the ghetto<br>
                    Dismissal, I'm not a fair man<br>
                    Disgraced the race of an atheist<br>
                    Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot<br>
                    One track sliced without swords<br>
                    I buried the Christ corpse in my past life<br>
                    When the black knight mounted the white horse<br>
                    And stay over-worked<br>
                    It's like the Nazis and the nation collaboratin'<br>
                    Attemptin' to take over the Earth

                    So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle<br>
                    I breathe ether in three lethal amounts<br>
                    While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle (Ahh)<br>
                    Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range<br>
                    Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain<br>

                    I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough<br>
                    To kill my soul after I'm dead<br>
                    When in danger, it's funny<br>
                    Actually my flavor's similar to a waiter<br>
                    'Cause I serve any stranger with money<br>
                    I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains<br>
                    While slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches<br>
                    Piss on a flag and burn it<br>
                    Murder you then come to your funeral service lobby<br>
                    And strangle your body to confirm it<br>
                    Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws<br>
                    With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass<br>
                    I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees<br>
                    Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me<br>
                    From all angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough<br>
                    To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt

                And so, that's the story of when Bad meets Evil<br>
                Two of the most wanted individuals in the county<br>
                Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens<br>
                It's too bad they had to go out the way they did<br>
                Got shot in the back comin' out of that old saloon<br>
                But their spirits still live on 'til this day<br>
                Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?
