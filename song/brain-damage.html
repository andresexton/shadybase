                    These are the results of a thousand electric volts<br>
                    A neck with bolts (Nurse we're losin' him, check the pulse)<br>
                    A kid who refused to respect adults<br>
                    Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
                </p>
                <p>
                    A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery<br>
                    'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me<br>
                    And I might snap, one day just like that<br>
                    I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first day in junior high, this kid said<br>
                    &ldquo;It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon, you die&rdquo;<br>
                    I looked at my watch, it was 1:20<br>
                    &ldquo;I already gave you my lunch money, what more do you want from me?&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    He said, &ldquo;Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse&rdquo;<br>
                    My palms were sweaty and I started to shake at first<br>
                    Somethin' told me, &ldquo;Try to fake a stomach ache, it works&rdquo;<br>
                    I screamed, &ldquo;Ow, my appendix feel like they could burst&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Teacher, teacher, quick, I need a naked nurse&rdquo;<br>
                    (&ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo;) &ldquo;I don't know, my leg, it hurts&rdquo;<br>
                    (&ldquo;Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy?&rdquo;)<br>
                    &ldquo;Oh I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    (&ldquo;Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over&rdquo;)<br>
                    (&ldquo;And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework&rdquo;)<br>
                    &ldquo;But don't you wanna give me after school detention?&rdquo;<br>
                    (&ldquo;Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'mm'a let him&rdquo;)

                <p>
                    Way before my baby daughter Hailie<br>
                    I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey<br>
                    An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes<br>
                    So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'<br>
                    And had me in the position to beat me into submission<br>
                    He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose<br>
                    Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef<br>
                    But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe<br>
                    He looked at me and said, &ldquo;You gonna die, honky&rdquo;<br>
                    The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made 'em think they beat me to death<br>
                    Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left<br>
                    Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth<br>
                    Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools<br>
                    This is for every time you took my orange juice<br>
                    Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk<br>
                    Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm gettin' you back bully, now once and for good<br>
                    I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could<br>
                    And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood<br>
                    Knocked him down and stood on his chest with one foot
                </p>
                <p>
                    Made it home later that same day<br>
                    Started readin' a comic and suddenly everything became gray<br>
                    I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read<br>
                    I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
                </p>
                <p>
                    My mother started screamin', &ldquo;What are you on, drugs?&rdquo;<br>
                    &ldquo;Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug&rdquo; (&ldquo;I'm sorry&rdquo;)<br>
                    She beat me over the head with the remote control<br>
                    Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
                </p>
                <p>
                    I picked it up and screamed, &ldquo;Look bitch, what have you done?&rdquo;
                    (&ldquo;Oh my God, I'm sorry son&rdquo;) Shut up, you cunt<br>
                    I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head<br>
                    Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck
                </p>
