                <p>
                    One day I plan to be a family man, happily married<br>
                    I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried<br>
                    'Til I'm glad to be buried and leave this crazy world<br>
                    And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may be early to be plannin' this stuff<br>
                    'Cause I'm still strugglin', hard to be the man and it's tough<br>
                    'Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough<br>
                    I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed<br>
                    My hands have been cuffed
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff, or plan to give up<br>
                    The minute shit hits the fan and erupts<br>
                    I'm antein' up, double or nothin'<br>
                    I've been troubled enough and I'm sick of strugglin' and sufferin'
                </p>
                <p>
                    See, my destiny's to rest in ease 'til I'm impressed and pleased<br>
                    With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese<br>
                    I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call<br>
                    Way before my baby is able to crawl
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates<br>
                    To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades<br>
                    I see the golden gates to Heaven on Earth<br>
                    Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you're steppin' on turf, Kyu

                    I'm goin' for broke, gamblin' and playin' for keeps<br>
                    Every day in the streets, scramblin' and payin' for cheap<br>
                    Prayin' for sleep, dreamin' with a waterin' mouth<br>
                    Wishin' for a better life for my daughter and spouse<br>
                    In this slaughterin' house
                </p>
                <p>
                    Caught up in bouts with the root of all evil<br>
                    I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful<br>
                    And make 'em do shit illegal for these Grants and Jacksons<br>
                    These transactions explain a man's actions
                </p>
                <p>
                    But in the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity<br>
                    Through God and there's a wish he granted me<br>
                    He showed me how to cope with the stress<br>
                    And hope for the best, instead of mopin' depressed
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always gropin' a mess or flyin' over the nest<br>
                    To sellin' dope with the rest, I quit smokin' cess to open my chest
                    Life is stressful inside this cesspool<br>
                    Try'na to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
                </p>
                <p>
                    My little brother's try'na to learn his mathematics<br>
                    He's asthmatic, runnin' home from school away from crack addicts<br>
                    Kids attract static, children with automatics<br>
                    Takin' target practice on teens for Starter jackets
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm usin' smarter tactics to overcome this slum<br>
                    I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum<br>
                    It's cumbersome, I'm try'na to do well on this Earth<br>
                    But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth
