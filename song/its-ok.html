                <p>
                    One day I plan to be a family man, happily married<br>
                    I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried<br>
                    'Til I'm glad to be buried and leave this crazy world<br>
                    And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may be early to be plannin' this stuff<br>
                    'Cause I'm still strugglin', hard to be the man and it's tough<br>
                    'Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough<br>
                    I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed, my hands have been cuffed
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff, or plan to give up<br>
                    The minute shit hits the fan and erupts<br>
                    I'm antein' up, double or nothin'<br>
                    I've been troubled enough and I'm sick of strugglin' and sufferin'
                </p>
                <p>
                    See, my destiny's to rest in ease 'til I'm impressed and pleased<br>
                    With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese<br>
                    I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call<br>
                    Way before my baby is able to crawl
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates<br>
                    To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades<br>
                    I see the golden gates to Heaven on Earth<br>
                    Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you're steppin' on turf, Kyu

                    I'm goin' for broke, gamblin' and playin' for keeps<br>
                    Every day in the streets, scramblin' and payin' for cheap<br>
                    Prayin' for sleep, dreamin' with a waterin' mouth<br>
                    Wishin' for a better life for my daughter and spouse in this slaughterin' house
                </p>
                <p>
                    Caught up in bouts with the root of all evil<br>
                    I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful<br>
                    And make 'em do shit illegal for these Grants and Jacksons<br>
                    These transactions explain a man's actions
                </p>
But in the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mopin' depressed
Always gropin' a mess or flyin' over the nest
To sellin' dope with the rest
I quit smokin' cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Tryin' to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's tryin' to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, runnin' home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Takin' target practice on teens for Starter jackets
I'm usin' smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm tryin' to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth
