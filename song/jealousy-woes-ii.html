                    Jealous? What he mean &ldquo;jealous&rdquo;, you know what I'm sayin'?<br>
                    He just mad 'cause he all with them ugly hoes, you know what I'm sayin'?<br>
                    Girls don't buy him no clothes, he bought that hoe some clothes<br>
                    He don't buy me no clothes and they ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick<br>
                    I mean, what do I got to be jealous fo'? He ain't gonna make it nowhere<br>
                    He ain't got no type of time, he has no career move, I mean&mdash;

                <p>
                    I come home every single day from workin' double shifts<br>
                    And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts<br>
                    I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me<br>
                    Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again you frisk me for numbers, try'na bust me<br>
                    It must be only just because you never learned to trust me<br>
                    Plus, we only squabble over irrelevant issues<br>
                    Too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
                </p>
                <p>
                    I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me<br>
                    I bring you diamond rings, you say I'm bad at timin' things<br>
                    So what's a man to do when all I hand to you is handed back to me?<br>
                    You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used to love your company, now you're always pumpin' me<br>
                    For information, and you tell your friends you plan on dumpin' me<br>
                    So I'mma wait for your evacuation<br>
                    'Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
                </p>
                <p>
                    See, I've never been so sure and you're just insecure<br>
                    So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure<br>
                    I recommend you take your things and check 'em in<br>
                    Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, say what?

                <p>
                    I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments<br>
                    I used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents<br>
                    Until the day I started followin' your feetprints<br>
                    And tappin' in your phone conversations through the heat vents
                </p>
                <p>
                    It made complete sense, there's someone else you like<br>
                    So I confronted you and asked you, who was Mike, and you was like<br>
                    &ldquo;I need a new nigga, someone rich that I could follow<br>
                    And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow!&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leavin' me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so brokenhearted<br>
                    I fell apart when you departed, then the jokin' started<br>
                    I was an open target, you play comedian<br>
                    And I became the laughing stock, but now I'm on my feet again
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so we meet again, you're actin' like an ex-wife<br>
                    All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife<br>
                    It goes, &ldquo;You didn't want me to see yo' hon, don't want me now<br>
                    Take the towel, wipe your brow!&rdquo; Quit try'na hunt me down
                </p>
                <p>
                    You run me down and now you're tryin' to apologize<br>
                    For all the lies and every time you made me bawl my eyes<br>
                    Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it<br>
                    Jealousy is in the house, y'all&mdash; fellas, sing it
