                    Jealous? What he mean &ldquo;jealous&rdquo;, you know what I'm sayin'?<br>
                    He just mad 'cause he all with them ugly hoes, you know what I'm sayin'?<br>
                    Girls don't buy him no clothes, he bought that hoe some clothes<br>
                    He don't buy me no clothes and they ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick<br>
                    I mean, what do I got to be jealous fo'? He ain't gonna make it nowhere<br>
                    He ain't got no type of time, he has no career move, I mean&mdash;

            <div class="lyricsDetail">
                <p>
                    I come home every single day from workin' double shifts<br>
                    And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts<br>
                    I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me<br>
                    Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again you frisk me for numbers, try'na bust me<br>
                    It must be only just because you never learned to trust me<br>
                    Plus, we only squabble over irrelevant issues<br>
                    Too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
                </p>
                <p>
                    I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me<br>
                    I bring you diamond rings, you say I'm bad at timin' things<br>
                    So what's a man to do when all I hand to you is handed back to me?<br>
                    You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used to love your company, now you're always pumpin' me<br>
                    For information, and you tell your friends you plan on dumpin' me<br>
                    So I'mma wait for your evacuation<br>
                    'Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
                </p>
                <p>
                    See, I've never been so sure and you're just insecure<br>
                    So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure<br>
                    I recommend you take your things and check 'em in<br>
                    Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, say what?

                    I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments<br>
                    I used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents<br>
                    Until the day I started followin' your feetprints<br>
                    And tappin' in your phone conversations through the heat vents
                </p>
                <p>
                    It made complete sense, there's someone else you like<br>
                    So I confronted you and asked you, "Who was Mike?" And you was like
"I need a new nigga! Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow!"
Leavin' me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so brokenhearted
I fell apart when you departed, then the jokin' started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughingstock, but now, I'm on my feet again
And so, we meet again, you're actin' like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
It goes, "You didn't want me to see yo' hon, don't want me now
Take the towel, wipe your brow!" Quit tryin' to hunt me down!
You run me down and now you're tryin' to apologize
For all the lies and every time you made me bawl my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house, y'allâ€” fellas, sing it!
