                    &lsquo;Life&rsquo;, by Marshall Mathers<br>
                    What is life?<br>
                    Life is like a big obstacle<br>
                    In front of your optical to slow you down<br>
                    And every time you think you've gotten past it<br>
                    It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground<br>
                    What are friends?<br>
                    Friends are people that you think are your friends<br>
                    But they really your enemies with secret identities<br>
                    In disguises to hide they true colors<br>
                    So just when you think you close enough to be brothers<br>
                    They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'<br>
                    What is money?<br>
                    Money is what makes a man act funny<br>
                    Money is the root of all evil<br>
                    Money'll make them same friends come back around<br>
                    Swearin' that they was always down<br>
                    What is life?<br>
                    I'm tired of life
                </p>

                    Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins<br>

                    Tired of not havin' a deal<br>
                    Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel

                    I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five-fifty an hour<br>
                    Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off

                    For this jerk breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk<br>
                    I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware<br>
                    Tired of workin' at Builder's Square, tired of not bein' a millionaire
