                    Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open<br>

                        I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine<br>
                        I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'<br>

                        Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush<br>
                        Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed<br>
                        Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
