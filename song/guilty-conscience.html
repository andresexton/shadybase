                    Meet Eddie, 23 years old. Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store. But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart, and suddenly his conscience comes into play.

                    Alright, stop (Huh)<br>
                    Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store<br>
                    And try to get money out the drawer<br>
                    You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)<br>
                    I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
                </p>
                <p>
                    My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin'a get my head straight<br>
                    But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate<br>
                    And Dr. Dre said, <em>"Slim Shady, you a basehead"</em>, Uh-uh<br>
                    <em>"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted"</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else<br>
                    'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt<br>
                    Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off<br>
                    And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
                </p>
                <p>
                    I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass<br>
                    Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast<br>
                    Come here, slut (&ldquo;Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg&rdquo;)<br>
                    I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

                    My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high<br>
                    Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five<br>
                    I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler<br>
                    And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper
                </p>
                <p>
                    Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up<br>
                    Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup<br>
                    Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship<br>
                    While they're screaming at me, &ldquo;Let's just be friends&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ninety-nine per cent of my life I was lied to<br>
                    I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)<br>
                    I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper<br>
                    Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh, thank you)
                </p>
                <p>
                    You know you blew up when the women rush your stands<br>
                    And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans<br>
                    This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph<br>
                    So I signed it, &ldquo;Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole&rdquo;

                    Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)<br>
                    Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate<br>
                    I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)<br>
                    I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive (Haha, yup)

                    All my life I was very deprived<br>

                    When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits<br>
