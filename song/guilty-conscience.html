                    Meet Eddie, 23 years old. Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store. But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart, and suddenly his conscience comes into play.

                    <em>Dr. Dre:</em><br>
                    Alright, stop (Huh?)<br>
                    Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store<br>
                    And try to get money out the drawer<br>
                    You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)<br>
                    I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Eminem:</em><br>
                    That's nonsense, go in and gaffle the money<br>
                    And run to one of your aunt's cribs<br>
                    And borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs (Can I borrow this?)<br>
                    Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days<br>
                    If you shave your legs with Renee's razorblades
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Dr. Dre:</em><br>
                    Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to<br>
                    The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you<br>
                    Think about it before you walk in the door first<br>
                    Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Eminem:</em><br>
                    Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch<br>
                    Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?<br>
                    Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?<br>
                    Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Dr. Dre:</em><br>
                    Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)<br>
                    Not over this shit (<em>Eminem:</em> Stop!)<br>
                    Drop the biscuit (I will)<br>
                    Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you<br>
                    <em>Eminem:</em><br>
                    You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude
