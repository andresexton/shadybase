                    Doctor slapped my mama, &ldquo;Bitch, you got a sick kid&rdquo;<br>
                    Arrested, molested myself and got convicted

                    Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder<br>
                    Jumped out (Rah), killed the bitch and did her<br>
                    Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smoke a blunt while I'm titty-fucking Bette Midler (Ahh, ahh)<br>
                    Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler<br>

                    I lace tunes that's out this world like space moons<br>
                    With a bunch of crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds<br>
                    Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits<br>
                    Doin' whippets, passed out like sampler snippets (Hi)

                <p>
                    Where's the weed? I wanna tamper with it, I'mma let your grandpa hit it<br>
                    Lace it up with cocaine, so he can't forget it<br>
                    Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum<br>

                <p>
                    So what I'm on is way beyond the rum or any alcoholic beverage<br>
                    Losing all of my leverage<br>
                    Went up inside the First National Bank broke and left rich<br>
                    Walking biohazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dandruff's making my neck itch What the fuck? Give me the check, bitch<br>
                    You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast (The fuck is this?)<br>
                    Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips (Pew)<br>
                    Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slap dips, support domestic violence<br>
                    Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence (Hahahaha)<br>
                    I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?<br>

                    Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England<br>
                    I'm out the game, put the second string in<br>

                    &ldquo;Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
