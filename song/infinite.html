                    Aw yeah (It's like this), it's Eminem, baby<br>
                    Back up in that motherfuckin' ass ('Til forever)<br>
                    One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For emcees)<br>
                    We represent the 313, you know what I'm sayin'?<br>
                    Yo, they don't know shit about this, for the nine-six

                <p>
                    Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction<br>
                    To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action<br>
                    A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction<br>
                    You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
                </p>
                <p>
                    My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills<br>
                    I travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills<br>
                    I'm slimin' grills of roaches with spray that disinfects<br>
                    And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
                </p>
                <p>
                    Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up<br>
                    Twist 'em up and indulge in the marijuana smog<br>
                    This is the season for noise pollution contamination<br>
                    Examination of more car-tunes than animation
                </p>
                <p>
                    My lamination of nar-er-ration<br>
                    Hits a snare and bass on a track for duck rapper interrogation<br>
                    When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'<br>
                    I turn the stage into a barren wasteland, I'm infinite

                    You heard'a Hell, well I was sent from it<br>
                    I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments<br>
                    Now I'm tryin'a repent from it, but when I hear the beat<br>
                    I'm tempted to make another attempt at it, I'm infinite

                    Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense<br>
                    I got some meat to mince, some fruit to stomp, and then two feet to rinse<br>
                    I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans<br>
                    I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
                </p>
                <p>
                    My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal<br>
                    One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people<br>
                    Emcees are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium<br>
                    Battle a band of phony emcees and stand the lonely one
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imitator, intimidator, stimulator<br>
                    Simulator of data, eliminator<br>
                    There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus<br>
                    Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
                </p>
                <p>
                    My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces<br>
                    My a cappella releases, classic masterpieces, through telekinesis<br>
                    It eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally<br>
                    With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite

                    Man I got evidence, I'm never dense, and I've been clever ever since<br>
                    My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO<br>
                    So I'm assumin' all responsibility<br>
                    'Cause there's a monster real in me that always wants to kill emcees
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler<br>
                    Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler<br>
                    No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical<br>
                    I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
                </p>
                <p>
                    I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical<br>
                    I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy<br>
                    In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine<br>
                    A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
                </p>
                <p>
                    So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo<br>
                    On my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B<br>
                    Be all you can be, 'Cause once you make an instant hit I'm tensed a bit<br>
                    And tempted when I see the sins my friends commit, I'm infinite
