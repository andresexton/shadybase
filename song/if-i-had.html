                    &lsquo;Life&rsquo;, by Marshall Mathers. What is life? Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down, and every time you think you've gotten past it, it's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground. What are friends? Friends are people that you think are your friends, but they really your enemies with secret identities, in disguises to hide they true colors. So just when you think you close enough to be brothers, they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'. What is money? Money is what makes a man act funny. Money is the root of all evil. Money'll make them same friends come back around, swearin' that they was always down. What is life? I'm tired of life.

                    I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins<br>
                    I'm tired of committin' so many sins<br>
                    Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins<br>
                    Tired of never havin' any ends
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tired of havin' skinny friends hooked on crack and Mini Thins<br>
                    I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins<br>
                    Tired of not havin' a deal<br>
                    Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tired of drownin' in my sorrow<br>
                    Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo<br>
                    I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off<br>
                    I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five-fifty an hour<br>
                    Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough<br>
                    Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk<br>
                    For this jerk breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk<br>
                    I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware<br>
                    Tired of workin' at Builder's Square, tired of not bein' a millionaire

                        But if I had a million dollars<br>
                        I'd buy a damn brewery<br>
                        And turn the planet into alcoholics
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I had a magic wand<br>
                        I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on<br>
                        While I'm on the john
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I had a million bucks<br>
                        It wouldn't be enough<br>
                        'Cause I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I had one wish<br>
                        I would ask for a big enough ass<br>
                        For the whole world to kiss
