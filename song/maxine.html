                    I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine<br>
                    She tests positive, but tells you that her act's clean<br>
                    Plus she got a sugar daddy<br>
                    Gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you mistook her, sadly on her reputation<br>
                    You're in jeopardation if you ain't got no preparation<br>
                    When you stepped away son, she got her face done<br>
                    Lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if
                </p>
                <p>
                    You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you<br>
                    If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice<br>
                    But when you catch the lice or get the urgency<br>
                    To go to the emergency 'cause it burns to pee
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't bring your germs to me, 'cause I ain't try'na hear it<br>
                    While you're fightin' your fuckin' disease try'na clear it

                    Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life?<br>
                    That is to get with every brother and unveil one of his kids<br>
                    Shit, you livin' trife<br>
                    Got three kids at home and club-hoppin' every night
                </p>
                <p>
                    You say it's gonna stop<br>
                    But it just slows down<br>
                    And then speeds back to a regular pace<br>
                    There is no end to this
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mystery, whatever your reason even tends to be<br>
                    You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that<br>
                    When you got niggas hidin' in your closet?<br>
                    I refrain from gettin' angry, but you keep on actin' strangely

                <p>
                    I met this girl last week, she was a freak and she liked me<br>
                    So I stepped on it and then asked my homies<br>
                    And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas<br>
                    Spit game over there and take notes, while I get this number
                </p>
                <p>
                    I stepped to her, first I cleared my throat<br>
                    And said, &ldquo;Hey, bitch, haven't I seen you before?&rdquo;<br>
                    Looked at my nigga, turned around and got slapped<br>
                    Threw out my hands and said, &ldquo;Oh, it's like that?&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit<br>
                    She started cryin' and asked me to forgive her and shit<br>
                    She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number<br>
                    She asked could I give her mine too
                </p>
                <p>
                    Got to the crib and called her up<br>
                    We got into a good conversation, that's when she asked me could I fuck<br>
                    I said, &ldquo;Maxine, check this out<br>
                    Give me your address, I'll be through, and you'll find out&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Got to the crib, she let me in<br>
                    She didn't waste time, she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom<br>
                    I said, &ldquo;Hold up and stop proceedin', you rushin' things!<br>
                    What the fuck are you doin'?&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I went for my protection, took off my clothes<br>
                    And started flexin' as she went for my midsection<br>
                    I threw her down as I tore off her shirt<br>
                    Pulled out my jimmy and thought about puttin' in work
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before I hit it, she said, &ldquo;Three, don't get mad<br>
                    But there's somethin' that I gotta tell your ass&rdquo;<br>
                    I said, &ldquo;What is it? Another nigga? It's okay&rdquo;<br>
                    She said: &ldquo;No, I forgot to tell you that I got AIDS, I got a problem.&rdquo;
