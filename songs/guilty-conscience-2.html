                    Yeah, you happy now bitch? (<em>Yep</em>)<br>

                <p>
                    Why does it feel like I'm always being tortured?<br>
                    The bad apple spoils the whole orchard<br>
                    Used to read comic books to learn more words<br>
                    'Cause deep down I'm a dork, just a core nerd
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meaning nerd to the core 'til I'm cornered, then I'm the coroner<br>
                    What shot is this &mdash; first, second? (<em>It's your third</em>)<br>
                    Vision is more blurred, speech is more slurred<br>
                    Can't even form words
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's like a dream up inside of a dream I'm trapped in<br>
                    It's worse than I could've imagined, it's madness<br>
                    Can't wake up, try my damnedest but old habits are coming back<br>
                    And now transgenders attack us, frontwards and backwards<br>
                    They laugh and throw midgets at us (Ha!)

                    To be some kind of mean, vile, obscene, foul prick?<br>
                    I kick one freestyle 'bout beating down a special needs child<br>
                    And these people freak out (Timmy!)</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Told you we'd get slaughtered for sayin' &ldquo;Retarded&rdquo;<br>
                    <em>Aw, Marshall's getting a conscience</em> (Fuck you)<br>
                    <em>This may come as a shock or have you astonished regardless<br>
                    Here's the thing 'bout retarded people</em> (What?)<br>

                    Two can play that game (<em>What?</em>)<br>
                    You wanna judge people? (<em>Yeah</em>) Matter of fact<br>
                    Ain't you the same one who hated bullies calling you bad names? (<em>Yep</em>)
                    Then you turned around and did the exact same (<em>So?</em>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just immature and literally, you're still mentally thirteen<br>
                    And still thirsty for some controversy<br>
                    You're still pickin' on Christopher Reeves<br>
                    <em>Yeah, but you're me and we're a team<br>
                    So that means we're in cahoots</em>

                    So clearly, you're the accessory like jewelry<br>
                    You ain't the judge or the jury, you're just as guilty</em><br>

                <p>
                    <em>Oh, bitch it's a joke</em><br>
                    No it's not, it's embarrassing (<em>What?</em>)<br>
                    Like David Carradine found with a pair of jeans<br>
                    At his ankles (<em>Ha-ha!</em>) and belt 'round his larynx<br>
                    <em>I know it's a scary scene, they're comin' with everything</em>

                    Fuck deaf people, yeah&mdash; <em>Well between me and you<br>
                    I think they've had it up to here with me too</em> (What the fuck?)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Sorry I'm not perfect as you, Marshall</em><br>
                    Punching down on little people? (<em>Yeah</em>) Not cool (<em>Whoops</em>)<br>
                    You just sound like a dick<br>
                    <em>Wait, nah fool</em> (What?)<br>
                    <em>When I say &ldquo;Fuck midgets&rdquo;, I mean Ja Rule</em> (Oh)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>And I know that Chris Reeves song was recorded in 2004 for Encore</em> (Yeah)<br>
                    <em>Fuck'd you take it off for?</em> ('Cause he died)<br>
                    <em>Man, that motherfucker did that bullshit<br>

                    Bitch, look at all the shit the media's puttin' me through (<em>What?</em>)<br>
                    'Cause of all the fucked shit that you pushed me to do (<em>Me?</em>)<br>
                    Should've knew when I found you, you were just too good to be true (<em>Hmm</em>)

                    That's how we'd end up in these quagmires, you said you had my back liar<br>
                    <em>But I helped you get your stacks higher</em> (Yeah)<br>
                    <em>That's diamond sales like sapphires<br>
