                <p>
                    Yo, some people say I'm wack, now if that's right<br>
                    I'm the freshest wack MC that you ever heard in your lifetime<br>
                    My slick a cappella sounds clever with the beats<br>
                    Boy, I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the street
                </p>
                <p>
                    Forget a gold digger's succubus, my soul's thick with ruggedness<br>
                    With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this<br>
                    I got more different strokes than Phillip Drummond<br>
                    On open mic I bone your woman just to keep my lyrics comin' (Bitch)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We elevated to new heights, premeditated, let it be<br>
                    That I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it<br>
                    He escalated, can be put to the test of greatness<br>
                    Snatch the heart from MCs and I ate it so I take it, that's the reason I'm hated
                </p>
                <p>
                    To represent's my temperament, if rap was a dick<br>
                    All you so-called hard MCs would not be impotent, but pimpin' it<br>
                    And actin' like you could rock a show (So?)<br>
                    Harder than LL's &ldquo;Rock the Bells&rdquo; and you's a ho
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, everything that you collaborate I lacerate<br>
                    My lines they keep comin' like nymphomaniacs that masturbate<br>
                    At a faster rate, yeah I got somethin' for your ass to hate<br>
                    I blast your hate and have you all runnin' past the gates
                </p>
                <p>
                    And as for face clutchin' and touchin' the flows<br>
                    I got 'em open like marijuana smoke up in your nose<br>
                    Buckin' these hoes, I got that shit down to a science<br>
                    Leavin' 'em hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
                </p>
                <p>
                    Defiance? No, we won't have that<br>
                    You want your shit to blow up?<br>
                    Well, I'mma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack<br>
                    And blast that shit to kingdom come<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then bring 'em some of this real hip-hop<br>
                    I'll drop beats and you ain't singin' and I do my thing and run<br>
                    And you all knew from Meeko<br>
                    That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Ferrigno<br>
                    So stop that bullshit flow<br>
                    Yo, you need to come with them real skills and act like you know
                </p>

                    Look, so what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?<br>
                    You don't know shit so when you see one, flee<br>
                    You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC<br>
                    I stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot<br>
                    I make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott<br>
                    Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me<br>
                    I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fuckin' memory
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's either them or me man, kill or be killed<br>
                    Your will'll be sealed, your casket closed, you'd still be billed<br>
                    My facility's filled with fans packed to capacity<br>
                    I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty (Ha)
                </p>
                <p>
                    If he's actin' soft and he cowers<br>
                    He better come cleaner than Jeru jackin' off when he showers<br>
                    You flowers got no clout with a thing<br>
                    You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
                </p>
                <p>
                    I shout with a slang simple as ABCs<br>
                    Skip over the Ds and rock the microphone with ease<br>
                    Dethrone MCs and I'mma max alone<br>
                    Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
                </p>
                <p>
                    So facts are known, biters get treated with shots<br>
                    I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks<br>
                    I'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers<br>
                    You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their fingers
                </p>
                <p>
                    But you can bring yours, let's see what you got<br>
                    But don't front and never try to be what you're not<br>
                    'Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back<br>
                    And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't jack
