                    And if men wanna wear lipstick and women's underwear, who cares?<br>
                    Their shit is their business, now bear witness, beware bitches<br>
                    The Blair Witch on you scared bitches<br>
                    I'm surreptitious (What?) on square business<br>
                    Just attacked my therapist with a pair of scissors like &ldquo;Merry Christmas&rdquo;<br>
                    Dressed as a Hare Krishna terrorist with a hair-trigger (Woo)
                </p>
                <p>
                    But with these buttons I'm always pushing (Yeah)<br>
                    Pain I'm always inflicting (What?)<br>
                    Protestors outside the Shady offices livid (Yeah)<br>
                    It'll make you think that you had the game on lock 'til they pick it (Trick it)<br>
                    Only way for me to explain it is I'm conflicted (What?)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Walkin' on eggshells, like if I take it too far is this it? (Yeah)<br>
                    Part of me gets it and wants to say I'm sorry and fix it (I'm sor&mdash;)<br>
                    So all my statements are basically contradictive (What?)<br>
                    Like using the F-word for gay is wrong and offensive (What?)
                </p>
                <p>
                    And insensitive as if me sayin' the R-word isn't (Wait)<br>
                    Wait a minute, which R-word? Rape or retarded, midget? (Not cool, guys)<br>
                    Would this rhyme be okay if South Park had did it? (Okay, screw you guys)<br>
                    Would it make you less angry if Cartman spit it? (Goddammit)
                </p>
                <p>
                    And as far as what I just stated regarding midgets<br>
                    You'll probably think I'll just say that I'm playin', I'm not I meant it (Yeah)<br>
                    Swear to God I see one of them little fuckers come at me<br>
                    I'll pick it up by its legs and drop it and kick it
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Marshall, you're wicked, face it, you are addicted&rdquo; (I know)<br>
                    But they gon' do me the same as DaBaby with all of this shit (Why?)<br>
                    Chappelle and Colin, they're callin' Shady misogynistic (Yeah)<br>
                    While raisin' three daughters, two graduated from college with honors<br>
                    Summa cum laude, my sense of humor is probably twisted<br>
                    It's painfully obvious that
