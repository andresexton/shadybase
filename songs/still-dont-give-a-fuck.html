                    A lot of people ask me<br>
                    Am I afraid of death?<br>
                    Hell yeah I'm afraid of death<br>
                    I don't wanna die yet<br>
                    A lot of people think that I worship the Devil<br>
                    That I do all types of retarded shit<br>
                    Look, I can't change the way I think<br>
                    And I can't change the way I am<br>
                    But if I offended you, good<br>
                    'Cause I still don't give a fuck

                    I'm zonin' off'a one joint, stoppin' a limo<br>
                    Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint<br>
                    A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?<br>
                    Fuck a needle here's a sword, body pierce with this
                </p>
                <p>
                    Livin' amuck, never givin' a fuck<br>
                    Give me the keys I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck<br>
                    But I smoke dope in the cab<br>
                    I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab<br>
                    Come back the next week and reopen your scab (Yeah)
                </p>
                <p>
                    A killer instinct runs in the blood<br>
                    Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud<br>
                    I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs<br>
                    I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
                </p>
                <p>
                    My brain's gone, my soul's worn, my spirit is torn<br>
                    The rest of my body's still bein' operated on<br>
                    I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme<br>
                    'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time

                    I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you<br>
                    And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled it was still blue<br>
                    I'll hang you 'til you dangle and chain you with both ankles<br>
                    And pull you apart from both angles
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins<br>
                    And bust open like broken water mains<br>
                    So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb<br>
                    'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm

                    Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm<br>
                    So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb<br>
                    Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on<br>
                    And the pants to match (&ldquo;Here Momma, try 'em on&rdquo;)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives<br>
                    A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives<br>
                    (Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents<br>

                    I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it<br>
                    Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)<br>
                    Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?<br>
                    I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet

                <p>
                    Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches<br>
                    I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches<br>
                    I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches<br>
                    Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes

                <p>
                    Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse<br>
                    Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me<br>
                    From the second I was born, my momma lost me<br>
                    I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy

                    My worst day on this earth was my first birthday<br>
                    Retarded? What did that nurse say?<br>
