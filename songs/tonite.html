                    I'm givin' mad love, I'm snugglin' hugs, strugglin' thugs<br>
                    Smugglin' drugs, jugglin' jobs, guzzlin' jugs<br>
                    So here's a toast to federal checks<br>
                    Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
                </p>
                <p>
                    We travel in packs, unravelin' facts<br>
                    And gravel in cracks to find babblin' Max, gafflin' tracks<br>
                    I grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts<br>
                    Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stealin' my art when I sculpt it<br>
                    The culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split<br>
                    Then I bury the hatchet, I carry the fat shit<br>
                    Butter Fingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
                </p>
                <p>
                    Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two<br>
                    Smoke a little bit and follow one of you back home<br>
                    When the party ends, so tonight I'm droppin' naughty hints<br>
                    To the finest women in the audience

                    Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalers<br>
                    Livin' as scandalous as a television evangelist<br>
                    But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter, crime fighter<br>
                    Caped crusader, takin' care of undeservin' limelighters
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think we live an era meant for me<br>
                    Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally<br>
                    When I stumbled upon this resolution<br>
                    By usin' a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
                </p>
                <p>
                    You couldn't see me with binoculars, I'm armed like an octopus<br>
                    Step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed<br>
                    Talkin' that junk like you had Black Bart at your back<br>
                    Come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I represent it and will have a referee in it<br>
                    Every minute, so when I win it you never resent it<br>
                    I'm forever demented, come up with funk I'll never be scented<br>
                    You got the point when I cleverly sent it

                    Eminem is headed skyward, for those who thought that I would<br>
                    Make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood<br>
                    I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me<br>
                    With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
                </p>
                <p>
                    So get your cameras and capture how miraculous<br>
                    I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how wack you was<br>
                    I meant it as a diss, 'cause you don't posses the pizzazz of this<br>
                    I'm hazardous enough already as it is
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without you addin' fuel to the fire, I'm cruel to the liar<br>
                    Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire<br>
                    Clinical studies show that I'm cynical<br>
                    There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm sure the party people can agree<br>
                    When I'm enchantin' with a romantically freakin' vocal so frantically<br>
                    So throw your hands up in the atmosphere and let 'em know<br>
                    The only party that was phat was here, just be like
