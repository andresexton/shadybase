                <p>
                    I'm reminiscin' on your tenderness and the snugglin' and teasin'<br>
                    Missin' what I remember, kissin' and huggin' and squeezin'<br>
                    Buggin' and wheezin', I'm havin' trouble when breathin'<br>
                    It's even tougher when sleepin'
                </p>
                <p>
                    But there's a couple of reasons that I'm sufferin' and grievin'<br>
                    For lovin' and leavin', you're all I'm thinkin' of in the evenin'<br>
                    You got my knees bucklin' and weakenin', thoughts of nothin' but freakin'<br>
                    That I'm strugglin' to keep in, interrupt when I'm speakin'
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got some game that I'm preparin' to run<br>
                    The way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun<br>
                    You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearin' you stun<br>
                    'Cause you're comparin' to none, I wanna share in the fun
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel a passionate lust<br>
                    When I imagine it just alone at last when it's us<br>
                    I see you graspin' to trust<br>
                    But my intentions are good, let's leave the past in the dust
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not askin' to rush and answer me immediately<br>
                    I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me<br>
                    If you agree, then repeat after me<br>
                    &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; (<em>Angela Workman:</em> I love you, baby)
                </p>
                <p>
                    'Cause I just need you to see how much I'm eager to be<br>
                    Your man legally wed, your love's keepin' me fed<br>
                    This is easily said, so you can lead or be led<br>
                    If you care to be down, 'cause ain't nobody like you nowhere to be found

                    Let's set a date up so you can follow through<br>
                    We'll take a spin in a Lexus, you can chill for dinner and breakfast<br>

                    We'll start it off with caviar, Dom P&#233;rignon<br>
                    And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on<br>
                    We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things<br>

                    It's still alright 'cause I got Minute Maid and Tanqueray<br>
                    You're an incredible one that's rare<br>
                    I bet in edible underwear you'll look impeccable, none compare

                    Now we all set to play, only thing left to say<br>
                    Is when you step away baby, look over in the negligee
