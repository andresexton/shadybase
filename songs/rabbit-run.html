                <p>
                    Some days I just wanna up and call it quits<br>
                    I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks<br>
                    Every time I go to get up, I just fall in pits<br>
                    My life's like one great big ball of shit
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I could just put it all into all I spit<br>
                    Instead of always try'na swallow it<br>
                    Instead of starin' at this wall and shit, while I sit<br>
                    Writer's block, sick of all this shit, can't call it shit
                </p>
                <p>
                    All I know is I'm about to hit the wall<br>
                    If I have to see another one of Mom's alcoholic fits<br>
                    This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it<br>
                    I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm like a skillet bubblin' until it filters up<br>
                    I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin' up<br>
                    Blow this buildin' up, I've concealed enough<br>
                    My cup runneth over, I done filled it up
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts<br>
                    You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts<br>
                    Well I'mma show you what, you gon' feel my rush<br>
                    You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peel the Dutch, I'm about to tear shit up<br>
                    Goosebumps, yeah I'mma make your hair sit up<br>
                    Yeah sit up, I'mma tell you who I be<br>
                    I'mma make you hate me 'cause you ain't me
                </p>
                <p>
                    You wait, it ain't too late to finally see<br>
                    What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see<br>
                    Whoever finds me's gonna get a finder's fee<br>
                    Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine<br>
                    All I need's a line, but sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme<br>
                    To express how I'm really feelin' at that time<br>
                    Yeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's just sometimes, it's always me<br>
                    How dark can these hallways be?<br>
                    The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three<br>
                    This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm desperate at my desk<br>
                    If I could just get the rest of the shit off my chest again<br>
                    Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'<br>
                    Fuck I'm stumped, but wait, here comes somethin'
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out<br>
                    New pad, crinkle it up and throw the shit out<br>
                    I'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out<br>
                    Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?<br>
                    Why am I a slave to this trade? Cyanide I spit to the grave<br>
                    Real enough to rile you up<br>
                    Want me to flip it? I can rip it any style you want
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter<br>
                    I'mma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a fuckin'<br>
                    Boilin' point, put some oil in your joints<br>
                    Flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed
                </p>
                <p>
                    An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense<br>
                    They hate me, see me and shake like a chainlink fence<br>
                    By the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin'<br>
                    By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin' someone
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the way they're runnin', you would swear the law was comin'<br>
                    It's now or never and tonight is all or nothin'<br>
                    &ldquo;Momma, Jimmy keeps leavin' on us<br>
                    &ldquo;He said he'd be back, he pinky promised, I don't think he's honest&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock<br>
                    Fuck this clock, I'mma make 'em eat this watch<br>
                    Don't believe me? Watch, I'mma win this race<br>
                    And I'mma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found my niche, you gon' hear my voice<br>
                    'Til you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice<br>
                    If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung<br>
                    If I have half a chance I'll grab it, rabbit run
                </p>
