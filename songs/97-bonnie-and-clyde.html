                    C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach<br>
                    Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat<br>
                    Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk<br>
                    Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk<br>
                    Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kinda late to go swimmin'<br>
                    But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women<br>
                    That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit<br>
                    Don't play with Dada's toy knife honey, let go of it (No)
                </p>
                <p>
                    And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?<br>
                    Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)<br>
                    And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float<br>
                    And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat<br>
                    It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt<br>
                    Her was eatin' dinner while you were sleepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt<br>
                    Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water<br>
                    And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

                    See honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell<br>
                    A place called prison and a place called jail<br>
                    And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one<br>
                    'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson<br>
                    And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)<br>
                    Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya<br>
                    But for now we'll just say Mama was real, real bad<br>
                    Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I still feel sad that I put her on time out<br>
                    Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin'a climb out<br>
                    I told you it's okay Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?<br>
                    Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?<br>
                    Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your diapee<br>
                    Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty<br>
                    And dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water<br>
